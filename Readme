##BUILT WITH:
  Android Studio
##HOW TO INSTALL: 
Unzip the github project to a folder. Open Android Studio. Go to File->Import Project. Then choose the specific project you want to import and then click Next->Finish. It will build the Gradle automatically and'll be ready for you to use.

P.S: In some versions of Android Studio a certain error occurs- error:package android.support.v4.app does not exist. To fix it go to Gradle Scripts->build.gradle(Module:app) and the add the dependecies:
```
dependencies {      
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])  
compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'  
}
```
